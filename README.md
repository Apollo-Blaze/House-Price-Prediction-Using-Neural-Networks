# üè† House Price Prediction Using Neural Networks

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model. The dataset used is from Kaggle's house sales prediction dataset.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle House Sales Prediction
- **Features**: id, date, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living, sqft_lot, floors, waterfront, view, condition, grade, sqft_above, sqft_basement, yr_built, yr_renovated, zipcode, lat, long, sqft_living15, sqft_lot15

## Results and Findings
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualized the distribution of house prices and relationships between features.
- **Model Building**: Built a neural network model with multiple layers.
- **Training**: Trained the model on the dataset with a validation split.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance using mean squared error.

## Conclusion
The neural network model was able to predict house prices with reasonable accuracy. Further improvements can be made by tuning the model and exploring additional features.
